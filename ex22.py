#No code in this exercise
'''First, go back through every exercise you have done so far and write down every word and symbol
(another name for “character”) that you have used. Make sure your list of symbols is complete.

Next to each word or symbol, write its name and what it does. If you can’t fi nd a name for a symbol
in this book, then look for it online. If you do not know what a word or symbol does, then go
read about it again and try using it in some code.

You may run into a few things you just can’t fi nd out or know, so just keep those on the list and
be ready to look them up when you fi nd them.

Once you have your list, spend a few days rewriting the list and double- checking that it’s correct.
This may get boring, but push through and really nail it down.

Once you have memorized the list and what they do, then you should step it up by writing out
tables of symbols, their names, and what they do from memory. When you hit some you can’t
recall from memory, go back and memorize them again.'''
